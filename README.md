Use this script to make the temperatures of your Raspberry Pis comparable. Run this script in different cases or compare your results with those of ExplainingComputers from Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbiGcwDWZjz05njNPrJU7jA).

If you have temperature values and want to share them with the community, just send me this and I will add them to the list.
