# ABOUT
Use this script to make the temperatures of your Raspberry Pis comparable. Run this script in different cases or compare your results with those of ExplainingComputers from Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbiGcwDWZjz05njNPrJU7jA).

If you have temperature values and want to share them with the community, just send me this and I will add them to the list.

# INSTALL
## install sysbench
`sudo apt install sysbench`

## install time
`sudo apt install time`

## make the script runable
`chmod +x temp_test.sh`
